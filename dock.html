<h1>Donating and How to?</h1>
<p>Donating can be everything you want to help us with. Everything can help us such as feedbacks on different things or paragraphs of the community, everything is shared with the server and will be kept in that way. The easiest way is to valunteer for a Tester, Helper or Creator which is simple.</p>

      <h1>Helpers</h1>  
      <p style="color:black;">Every Helper has a very discrete job to handle the server's chats, events and voice channels which can be very difficult and challenging when introduced to it. Every Staff will have his very own tasks and jobs to follow or be assigned new ones by the Captain.</p>
